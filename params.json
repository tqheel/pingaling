Pingaling actually creates a set of http Requests for a given set of sites and then evaluates the http Responses.\r\n\r\n## How To Use\r\n* Open the project in Visual Studio (.Net 4.0).\r\n* Modify the included sites.xml file to include the sites that you want to \"pingaling.\"\r\n* Build the project.\r\n* Copy the executable and sites.xml files from the debug folder to a directory of your choosing.\r\n* CD to that directory and type pingaling.\r\n* (Optional) Set-up Pingaling to run as as scheduled task in Windows Task Scheduler at the interval of your choosing.\r\n* Enjoy the goodness.\r\n\r\n"}
